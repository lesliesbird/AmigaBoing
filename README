Recreates the original Boing Ball demo from the Amiga computer. The ball rotates and bounces around the screen, while the time readout is using the original Amiga Topaz font.
Shake or tap the watch along the Y (negative) axis to change the pattern of the bounce. Best way is to hold the watch the way you look at it, then bring your arm abruptly towards your body

Version 3.6 - support for entire Pebble line. Completed just before the Announcement (Bye, Emery :( ) Ball graphics have been improved and now cast a dropshadow.
